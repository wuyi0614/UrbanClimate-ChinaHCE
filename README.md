# UrbanClimate-ChinaHCE
The repo for the data and codes from the paper about China's HCE to be published on Urban Climate.

## Outline

*Edited on 27 Oct 2023*

Notably, as accounting the carbon emission based on the survey is rather difficult, we use energy consumption instead for analysis.

*Title: City-level household energy consumption typology and implications: a machine learning-based approach(pending)*
- [ ] Abstract (dependent on findings) - YW
- [ ] Introduction & Literature Review
  - [ ] Cities account for a majority of energy consumption & household energy/lifestyle energy consumption
  - [ ] Understanding of Chinese cities' energy consumption and emissions
  - [ ] What approaches have been applied to explore HCEs and what findings regarding urban/rural HCEs
  - [ ] What gap exists in the current researches? -- highly dependent on a fixed range of factors, and lack of deep understanding of lifestyle and behaviors of Households
- [ ] Methodology and data description (& a graphic methodology)
  - [x] Survey samples - YW & ZYX
  - [x] Energy consumption and emission data processing and inequality analysis - YW
  - [ ] Machine learning approaches - ZYX
